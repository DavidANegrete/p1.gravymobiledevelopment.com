 			<h2>About Me</h2>
 			<p> Hello everyone! I am very happy to be taking this class because I want to learn how to make web applications. I have been creating HTML/CSS pages for about a year now. I am far from an expert developer. What I lack in experience I make up for in pure determination and curiosity. I am not afraid to try new things in my projects. Thus far, I have learned Java, C++, SQL, Python and Visual Basic. I am looking forward to a great semester of learning how to build web applications with PHP. My text editor of choice for this class is Sublime Text Version 2.0.2.  
 			</p>	
 		
 			<h2>Fun and Family</h2>
 			<p>When I am not working on projects, I either spend time with my wife and puppy or train. I love doing activities that test my endurance. I have done four marathons in the last four years and will be doing my fifth in February. I recently got into cycling and swimming. I completed my first triathlon two weeks ago and got second place in my age group and class. This coming week I will be competing in a 100K bike race.
